	<h1>Toliwaga</h1>
	<p>
	The name toliwaga dates back to a quixotic startup called GiftEcology that I founded with two friends many years ago.
	
	In "The Argonauts of the Western Pacific", Branislaw Malinowski explains that the toliwaga is the owner or sponsor of 
	a "masawa" canoe used by Trobriand Islanders to travel between islands to perform the ceremonial Kula exchange.
